# Challenge-1
So for Challenge 1 I was asked to use exisiting code and render the code so it follows accessibility standards.

So what I first did was change the website title to an apporiate one that best describes what the website is about.

I then replaced every div element with semantic ones such as; header, main, body, nav, section, article, and footer.

I then added the apporiate alt attributes to the icon and image elements

I also made sure that the codes fell in sequential order.

After, I then looked over the CSS and there I adjusted some codes, I noticed that alot of the codes were a bit repetitive so I combined all like codes into one single container.
